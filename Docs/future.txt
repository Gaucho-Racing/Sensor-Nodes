What does the future hold?
	Not much for me sadly :(
Why?
	Because I want to make this entire project to work with Zephyr RTOS
Why?
	Why not?


Software TODO:
	I2C
	UART
	SPI
	Zephyr RTOS maybe
	Clean code and comment for useability
	Add more examples
	

Hardware TODO:
	Lower price to try to add both USB and UART->USB controler
	Use TPS54331DR as a buck converter instead as it is cheaper (basic part @ JLC)
	Find an inductor that works w/ it
	Remap 5V and 12V (on silkscreen) because I fuck up
	Standardize the board so that it fits into breadboards
	Add some sort of mounting (most likely m3 holes)
	Maybe update current tranciver to TJA to make it more standard and remove J Pads
	Add either boot selector buttons or jumpers to B1 and B2 (make programming over USB possible)
		This still needs USHART1 and some sort of USB transciever 
	USB con most likely will be micro B as it is cheaper and teensy already has micro B
