Basic setup guide for the sensor nodes for GR24

What you want: 
	STM32CUBEMX
	STM32CUBEPROGRAMMER
	and if you fw the eclipse IDE you can go ahead and install the 
		STMCUBEIDE (bad)
	I recommend using vscode, it will make your life a lot easier.
	Also, I recommend watching the following video if you want to setup the 
		vscode and play around with stm32 HAL:
